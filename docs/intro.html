The Groovy organizer
Borrowing concepts from Eat That Frog! by Xxxxxx Xxxx

One of the characters in Huckleberry Finn remarked that if he had to eat a frog during the day, he'd just as soon get right up and eat it first thing, without dawdling any extra time thinking about it.

Eat That Frog! uses just this concept to plan a day. Of course there are millions of things we would love to get done in a day, but there just insn't time. I have experienced this in my own life. But some tasks are so important they would surely propel us forward in our journey if we accomplished them. To this end we must prioritize. A "frog", in our case is any important task that will make a big difference in our life. Frogs, as such, we will eat first thing, and our biggest, scariest looking frog always gets eaten first.

Then there are other tasks, seemingly menial, things that don't matter so much to our self-development or self-worth. They might be easy or enjoyable, but they just don't actally accomplish that much in the grand scheme of things. These are clearly not frogs, and must be eaten only after all the frogs for the day are eaten.

There are things more menial still, such as ones we would not care if they never got done.

And then there are things to be delegated to others.

Yes, thus far this is quite a sound system, all developed by Xxxxxx Xxxx in his book and audio series, "Eat That Frog!". And I have used his system quite unaltered for over a year and found it quite helpful. It gets me to concentrate on exactly what needs to be done the most.

However, a snag I run into occasionally. More often than that, I venture. A snag I run into when I get so focused eating some frog that is so huge it may take several days to eat it properly. And then I forget to do other things, other menial things, things that Xxxxxx Xxxx told me were less important, but such things that done a little at a time, would mean a lot to somebody.

It is to this end that I have produced this web site. It is so that I might at some point during the day stop eating that giant frog, in order to fit in a vegetable or to to my palate. Even though the frog remains, at some point I must rest or I must surely faint for exhaustion. And at some point I must juggle other tasks like eating, else I will not have the strength to keep eating my frog the next day.

What about when I need a break from eating that frog? How can I best rejuvenate myself? And once it's ealy afternoon and my brain has turned to mush, times as such I'd like destroy the frog instead of properly eating it, yet I have plenty of energy to get some other menial task done that I otherwise would ignore in the face of such mean, ugly frogs.

Thus you have the web site in front of you. It is not a scheduler per se. In most cases, it will not beep automatically at a certain time to remind you to do something. Rather, it will evaluate which frog is the biggest, and what time of day that frog is the ripest, most ready to eat, and it will assign you that course when it becomes most fortuitious to consume it.

Note that this is a method for being productive when you want to be productive. The idea is that you can't be productive all day, so take advantage of the energy you have when you have it. It also has built-in constructs to prevent you from spinning your wheels endlessly on something. Yes, sometimes it will be time to move on to something else, even though a particular task isn't done yet. That is how we become multi-taskers.

So, to get started, you will describe some of the tasks you have on your menu for the day. What times they are available to you, how long it would be appropriate to work on the task once you start, and what groove you must be in to make the most of eating such a frog. Then, once all your tasks are input, you will simply tell the website what groove you are currently in, and based on the information you have given it about your frogs and other tasks for the day, it will assign you a task.


For example, my mind is fresh for logic and other intensive things in the early morning.

-- that is, not unless it has been given a high enough priority.


This scheduling system is different from what you may be used to. The primary idea behind this is that certain tasks are best done when you are in a  certain frame of mind. Whether that be creative, purpose-driven, laxadaisical, or whatever. Some things can be done whenever, whether you are full of steam or just limping about-- such as letting your bread rise. But other things must be done when you are razor sharp-- like debugging lines of code or planning your life.
