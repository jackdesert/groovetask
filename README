GROOVETASK
===================
Groovetask is an electronic day planner that only plans a single day: TODAY.
It is currently hosted at http://groove.letseatalready.com, but you are
welcome to host it anywhere else you like, make additions to it, improve it,
etc.

When I decided to learn Python and Postgres in 2008, I needed a pet project to
apply them to. I was reading Brian Tracy's book, "Eat That Frog",
and decided to put his concepts into digital form.

You can read all about how GrooveTask works by reading the splash page
at http://groove.letseatalready.com. You can also create an account
and try it for yourself.

HOSTING REQUIREMENTS
=====================

GrooveTask runs on Python 2.4-2.6, mod_wsgi, and PostgreSQL. If you're
looking for cheap, robust hosting that offers PostgreSQL, try
