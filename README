GROOVETASK
===================
Plan your day by the groove you're in, not by what the clock tells you!
Groovetask is an electronic day planner that matches how you're feeling
RIGHT NOW to one of your daily to-dos that is perfect for that energy
level. You can read all about how GrooveTask works by reading the splash page
at http://groove.letseatalready.com. You can also create an account
and try it for yourself.

WHAT INSPIRED GROOVETASK?
=========================
In 2008 I was reading Brian Tracy's book "Eat That Frog", which basically
a book about how to accomplish the most important pieces on your plate,
instead of wheedling away time on unimportant nonsense. During that time,
I was also coming up to speed in Python and PostgreSQL, so to aid my
own development (and provide a useful tool), I put Brian Tracy's words
into digital action: GrooveTask.

HOSTING REQUIREMENTS
=====================

GrooveTask runs on Python 2.4-2.6, apache with mod_wsgi, and PostgreSQL.
